## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Yelp API Key (get one from [Yelp Developers](https://www.yelp.com/developers))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
cd CareRoute

# Install dependencies with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Set your Yelp API key in .env file
echo "YELP_API_KEY=your_yelp_api_key_here" > .env

# Option 1: Use interactive launcher (choose standard or enhanced)
chmod +x launch.sh
./launch.sh

# Option 2: Run enhanced version directly (RECOMMENDED)
uv run streamlit run run_app_enhanced.py

# Option 3: Run standard version
uv run streamlit run run_app.py
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit requests pydantic pydantic-settings
export YELP_API_KEY="your_yelp_api_key_here"
streamlit run run_app_enhanced.py
```

### Usage

#### Standard Version (run_app.py)
1. **Enter Business Details** - Business name, location, and type
2. **Analyze Reviews** - Click "🔍 Analyze Business" to extract insights
3. **Generate Scenarios** - Click "� Generate Scenarios" for practice situations
4. **Practice & Get Feedback** - Select a scenario, respond, get AI feedback

#### Enhanced Version (run_app_enhanced.py) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
1. **Set User Profile** - Enter your name in the sidebar
2. **Analyze Business** - Same as standard version
3. **Generate & Practice** - Same workflow with added difficulty levels
4. **Track Progress** - View your stats, badges, and trends in real-time
5. **Check Leaderboard** - See team rankings and top performers
6. **View Analytics** - Explore score trends and improvement charts
7. **Generate Reports** - Download comprehensive training session reports
8. **Earn Certification** - Achieve Bronze/Silver/Gold certification levels

## How It Works

### Step 1: Review Analysis
```
Business → Yelp AI → Extract Delights/Pains/Personas
```

Example output:
- **Delights**: "Customers love the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff"
- **Pains**: "Long wait times during lunch rush"
- **Personas**: "Busy weekday lunch customers expecting quick service"

### Step 2: Scenario Generation
```
Pains → Yelp AI → Training Scenarios (bad vs good dialogue)
```

Example scenario:
- **Title**: "Handling delayed orders at lunch rush"
- **Bad Example**: Staff makes excuses without empathy
- **Good Example**: Staff apologizes, explains, offers compensation

### Step 3: Practice & Feedback
```
Staff Response → Yelp AI → Score + Strengths + Improvements
```

Example feedback:
- **Score**: 8/10
- **Strengths**: "Good empathy, clear explanation"
- **Improvements**: "Could offer a specific compensation option"

## Example Businesses to Try

1. **Café** - "Calm Corner Café, Dallas, TX"
2. **Restaurant** - "Local Italian Restaurant, San Francisco, CA"
3. **Retail Store** - "Downtown Bookstore, Austin, TX"

## API Key Setup

Get your Yelp API key:

1. Go to https://www.yelp.com/developers
2. Create an account or log in
3. Create a new app
4. Copy your API key

Set it in your environment:

```bash
# Temporary (current terminal session)
export YELP_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Permanent (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
echo 'export YELP_API_KEY="your_key_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "YELP_API_KEY is not set"**
- Make sure you've exported the environment variable
- Restart your terminal after setting it

**Error: "Yelp AI API error 401"**
- Your API key is invalid or expired
- Get a new key from Yelp Developers

**"No valid JSON returned"**
- Yelp AI sometimes returns text instead of JSON
- Click the debug expander to see raw response
- Try again with more specific business name/location
